#### Risks

<Accordion title="What are the risks of staking with Spirals?" >

Staking with Spirals means that you can always redeem the staked asset. Let's
break down what that means for token supported today.

### Celo

When you stake Celo with Spirals, that is staked on validators that power Celo's
L1 consensus mechanism. Since L1 staking guarantees that staked Celo can be
withdrawn\*, Spirals is also able to make this claim. Today, we do this through
an audited liquid staking protocol called
[Staked Celo](https://docs.stcelo.xyz/).

_\*One small caveat here is_
[_slashing penalties_](https://docs.celo.org/protocol/pos/penalties)_. This is
why Staked Celo has a strict criteria for validator selection & rotation to
minimize the probability of slashing._

### cUSD

When you stake cUSD with Spirals, our vaults deposit cUSD as collateral into a
decentralized lending protocol called [Moola Market](https://moola.market/)
(fork of Aave V2). Moola Market tracks a health factor for each depositor that
measures the value of their collateral against the value of their debt. If the
ratio falls below 1 (loan becomes under collateralized), then a liquidation
event is triggered.

This stability mechanism ensures that Moola's lending pools are
over-collateralized so that there should always be enough liquidity to allow our
vaults to withdraw cUSD on behalf of a Spirals staker. On top of that, Spirals
does not take out any loans on Moola Market so our underlying cUSD collateral is
safe and will never be liquidated.

<Accordion title="Have the Spirals smart contracts been audited?">
  Yes! We completed our first audit with [Verilog
  Solutions](https://www.verilog.solutions/audits/spirals/) on September 12th, 2022.

#### Impact

<Accordion title="How is impact calculated?" >
Today, the impact of a Spirals user can be understood as "the amount of positive
climate work I've helped bring to life." Although not every project in the
portfolio focuses on sequestering carbon, we use tCO2 (tons of carbon) as a base
unit to understand our physical climate impact and an estimated cost of $15/ton
for nature-based carbon removal.

For example, let's say we have a user who is staking $10,000 across all green
token vaults (5% avg APY) and leaves it staked for a year. Then this user is
contributing $500 to climate projects, which equates to 33.33 tCO2 of physical
climate impact.

Conversion to other units like number of miles walked instead of driven was
calculated using numbers used by an open-sourced carbon footprint calculator
published by Berkley researchers:

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is impact double-counted?" >

No, because users of Spirals do not get to claim the carbon offset associated
with their yield contributions. This is instead understood to be the amount of
positive climate work they've helped bring to life, but is not contributing to
their individual carbon neutrality.

</Accordion>

#### Governance

<Accordion title="How are projects selected?" >
An independent council of climate experts review each climate impact project to
ensure we are listing high quality projects. This process will be eventually
completely open-sourced with an opportunity for SPRL token holders to become
engaged as well.

Learn more about how that works today
[here](https://docs.spirals.so/climate-impact/project-review-process).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is Spirals a DAO?" >
Eventually we will be, yes! Our approach to building Spirals is best summarized
by _**progressive decentralization**_.

For now we are mostly making decisions as a core team to learn quickly and
understand how things can be systematized. Our intention is to gradually
transition the decision-making process to on-chain governance coordinated by the
$SPRL token. More on that soon!

#### Supported Platforms

<Accordion title="What chains are supported today?">
  Today we support Celo. Soon we will support Ethereum and Polygon as well.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What wallets are supported today?" >
Today we support Metamask, Coinbase Wallet and most other wallets through
WalletConnect (Valora, Rainbow Wallet, etc.).

We also support Gnosis Safes for multisig staking!

#### Fees

<Accordion title="What are the fees for staking?" >
As a quick refresher, there are 3 types of projects on Spirals:

- **Collection** \- climate impact projects funded through forward contracts,
  part of the default Spirals Collection

- **Impact** \- climate impact projects, either `verified` or `pending review`
  by climate council

- **Ecosystem** \- projects that strengthen the ReFi ecosystem

The fees for staking depends on the type of project you are supporting. If a fee
applies, it is taken from the staking yield you earn through the protocol, which
means that you will still be able to withdraw 100% of your principal deposit.

- **Collection -** no fees

- **Impact** \- 2% for verified projects, 5% for unverified projects

- **Ecosystem** \- flat 5% fee

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the fees for getting listed as a project?">
  As a project, there are **no fees** for listing your project and setting up a
  project page üôÇ
