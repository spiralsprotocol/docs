## Welcome

We are _**extremely excited**_ for you to build on top of Spirals and increase
adoption of what we believe could be a new regenerative primitive. These docs
are meant to make things easier, but if you still have questions please don't
hesitate to reach out to [team@spirals.so](mailto:team@spirals.so)

Let's kick things off ðŸ™Œ

## What does it mean to build on Spirals?

Building on Spirals means that your users will be able to make an impact on the
climate problem by _**simply using your product!**_ This means that your app
also stands out as an effortless way to make transparent, verifiable impact.

Plugging into green tokens is the easiest way to make your crypto project green,
and we want you to be able to share that with your users ðŸŒ±

## Concepts

<Note>
  For a primer on gTokens, please see [Introduction](/green-tokens/introduction)
</Note>

At the core of Spirals are a set of **token vaults** (aka Impact Vault) that are
configured to...

1. Accept ERC-20 token deposits (ex: ETH)
2. Deploy the deposited tokens towards a low-risk yield strategy (ex: Lido
   liquid staking)
3. Generate yield by holding a non-rebasing yield token (ex: wstETH)
4. Issue new ERC-20 tokens that allow withdrawing the deposits (ex: gETH)
