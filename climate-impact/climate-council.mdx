  "The Spirals Climate Council (SCC) is a multi-disciplinary committee of
  experts that collectively hold a comprehensive understanding of the climate
  crisis. The Council is responsible for vetting and selecting the most
  promising climate impact projects to receive funding from the Spirals Protocol
  Impact Fund."

### Values

- To honor the complexity of natural systems and resist reductionism.
- To support transparency and validation of impact claims.
- To directly fund projects, limiting intermediaries as much as possible.
- To make regenerative financial tools accessible to non-technical people.

### Responsibilities

The SCC is responsible for upholding the integrity of the Spirals mission to
support climate impact projects. This includes vetting candidate projects for
being high quality with verifiable impact and selecting the best projects to
bring into the Spirals ecosystem for funding.

The SCC is also responsible to create and share proposals for a candidate
project's approval or denial, serving as a decision making tool and transparency
mechanism.

### Project Preference

The SCC has preference towards long-term, high-impact nature based solutions
that address a root cause of the climate crisis, not just a symptom.

The SCC strives to support projects that go beyond carbon to measure
biodiversity, soil health, groundwater, social impact, etc.

The SCC recognizes the importance of supporting projects in the early stages of
development when funding is more scarce, but more impactful. Forward contracts
will be a valuable tool to enable this early support.

### Decision Rights

The SCC makes the final decision on which projects are approved for Spirals
funding and support. To start, decisions are communicated through our community
discord and by email. However, going forward there are plans to build out a
discussion forum and end to end native experience.

### Decision Making Process

The SCC will use _consent_ decision making.

Unlike consensus, which looks to find a solution that everyone supports and
agrees with, consent seeks a decision that each of us can move forwards with
because we don't believe that doing so will cause significant harm.

### Advice Process

Members of the SCC will seek advice as needed from other network contacts with
relevant expertise.

For Spirals-related advice the SCC's point of contact will be Alex Corren,
Impact Lead.

### Time Commitment

Holding a position on the SCC will take around 5 hours per month of focused
attention, often in bursts.

The term length for SCC members starts at 6 months, with the opportunity to
serve multiple terms if re-elected by the SpiralsDAO community.
