title: "üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Project Review Process"
description: "Spirals is a community funded, expertly advised ecosystem."
---

This process is being reviewed and finalized right now. Please consider this
page a draft and share any feedback you have directly with
[team@spirals.so](mailto:team@spirals.so)

The community determines funding allocation, yet every project is reviewed. This
ensures that regardless of how a community votes across the portfolio of
projects, impact is maximized, and all projects available for support by the
community are high quality with verifiable impact.

Beyond projects that sequester carbon from the atmosphere, we are also keen to
support projects that deliver holistic planetary regeneration in increasing
biodiversity, restoring degraded habitats, etc.

1. Propose a project
2. Review By Core Team
3. Receive Funding as Ecosystem Project
4. Review By Climate Council
5. Receive Additional Funding in Spirals Collection

### Stage 1 - Propose A Project

Eventually, this will happen through a governance proposal. For now,
[please fill out this form](https://kw2tbik92mn.typeform.com/impact-project).

Projects should include as much information as they can about their approach to
impact and what the funds will be used for. This helps to provide a clear
picture of the mission and vision of the project, and convey the story behind
the work being done.

### Stage 2 - Initial Project Review

After creating a proposal, projects enter the review queue where community can
help in researching the impact potential. We recommended joining our
[Discord Community](https://discord.gg/Ry5NP2Vz) to tell people about why your
project should be approved and receive feedback.

For now, the core team at Spirals does a first pass at reviewing projects.

In the future, the community will be able to contribute to the review process.

### Stage 3 - Projects Receive Funding

Once a project is approved by the core team, it is listed on the Spirals dApp
and can start receiving yield from stakers.

Projects in this stage do not earn funding from the Collection but receive the
yield from stakers directly selecting their project.

Impact Funds will be released to these projects in batches. Projects are
expected to provide regular updates and verification to continue being listed
and receiving funding.

### Stage 4 - Climate Council Review

The [Climate Council](/climate-impact/climate-council) is a multi-disciplinary
committee of experts that collectively hold a comprehensive understanding of the
climate crisis. The Council is responsible for vetting and selecting the most
promising climate impact projects to receive funding from the Spirals
Collection.

<Accordion title="Potential projects will be assessed based on multiple factors." >

- What is the impact this project is making?

- Does the amount of capital available align with the funding the project needs
  to succeed?

- What are the co-benefits of this project?

- What are potential negative externalities associated with this project?

- Does the team behind this project have the expertise to accomplish said goals?

- How will the impact of this project be verified?

- Is this project managing a symptom of climate change, or addressing a cause?

- Is there a clear methodology that this project is using?

- Is this project tokenized?

</Accordion>

After a thorough analysis by the Climate Council, a decision will be made as to
whether or not the project is a good fit to join the Spirals Collection. The
entire decision making and analysis process will be transparent and publicly
available.

Projects that are not accepted will be told why that decision was made and will
be given an opportunity to clarify and/or improve. Projects that are approved
will be accepted to the collection.

### Stage 5 - Projects Receive Additional Funding

Approved projects are added to the Spirals Collection.

Impact Funds will be released to approved projects in batches. Regular updates
and verification of impact throughout the lifecycle of the project will be
required in order to stay active on the platform and eligible to receive
continued funding support from the Spirals community.

Note that the Climate Council can remove projects at any point if they are
failing to meet the expectations.
