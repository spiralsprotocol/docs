## Where can I use green tokens today?

Most gTokens can be immediately redeemed for the original deposit (no unlocking
period). Some gTokens have an unlocking period because their underlying yield
strategies are subject to the unlocking periods of L1 staking.

Today, we support these chains & tokens â€“ and we're hoping to bring you many
more soon ðŸ‘€

| Chain       | Token | Unlocking Period                           |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Ethereum ðŸ’Ž | ETH   | \*Withdrawals only available as Lido stETH |
| Polygon ðŸŸª  | USDC  | \-                                         |
|             | DAI   | \-                                         |
| Celo ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡   | CELO  | 3 days (72 hours)                          |
|             | cUSD  | \-                                         |

## Can I use them anywhere else?

We're working with a handful of dApps & protocols to integrate gTokens today,
and are super excited by the use cases that we're already starting to see:

- Paying DAO contributors with gTokens
- Disbursing grant funds as gTokens
- Facilitating recurring investments into gTokens
- Staking marketplace fees as gTokens

If you are building a web3 product and would like to integrate with gTokens,
please see the next section
[Building on Green Tokens](/building-on-green-tokens) to get started ðŸš€
