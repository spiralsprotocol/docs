## What are green tokens?

Green tokens (gTokens) represent cryptocurrencies in a vault earning yield that
committed towards funding impactful climate projects.

Green tokens are ERC-20 tokens that are always issued 1:1 for each token
deposited. They can always be used to redeem the underlying token from the vault
on a 1:1 basis as well!

#### Let's walk through a more concrete example ðŸ‘‡

Say you deposited 1 ETH into Spirals. At that point you are issued 1 Green ETH
(gETH). This gETH you are holding represents 1 ETH being put to work. In this
case, it's sitting in a vault and earning passively for amazing climate work!

By simply holding gTokens, you are making an impact and each vault has ways to
calculate exactly how much yield & impact is attributable to a single gToken
holder. Furthermore, like any ERC-20 gTokens can be transferred to other
wallets. When transfers happen, the receiver starts making an impact as well
that they can show off to the world ðŸ’ª

## What is the long-term goal?

We are actively working to make sure that gTokens can reach a level of adoption
and utility that make them a regenerative primitive in web3\. In the future,
whether they know it or not gToken holders will be continuously funding projects
that drawdown carbon, restore biodiversity, and heal our planet ðŸŒŽ
